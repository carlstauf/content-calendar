1 Executive Summary

Final Round AI publishes across TikTok, X, LinkedIn and Instagram. Planning in Notion + spreadsheets causes gaps, last-minute scrambles and no single source of truth.
The Content Calendar delivers a calendar-first workflow, AI-assisted planning and instant collaboration—tailored to the four content pillars below—while keeping cost and complexity near zero.

2 Content Pillars & Sub-Themes

Pillar	Sub-themes
Life at a Startup	• Finding an Internship • Product-Prep (Mock Interview, Q&A Product, Résumé Builder, AI Job Hunter)
Human and Introduction	• Company / Behind-the-Scenes • How We Operate • Who We Are • The Future We’re Creating
Life in SF	• Street Interviews • Local College Interviews • Other Interviews
Industry Insights	• AI trends, research, market moves

These strings are canonical; validation will reject anything else.

4 Personas & JTBD

Persona	“Jobs-to-be-Done”

5 Scope

5.1 Must-Have (MVP)
	1.	Calendar – Month / Week / List toggle; per-day dot per post (colour = platform).
	2.	Day Drawer – Clicking a date shows Scheduled posts for that day only; bulk duplicate / delete / shift +1 day.
	3.	Add / Edit Post Modal – Title, description (rich), platform, pillar, publishDate (ISO), status, imageUrl (optional).
	4.	Filters – Sidebar (desktop) or dropdown (mobile) for platform + pillar; sticky.
	5.	Real-time Updates – TanStack Query invalidates list on create / update / date-change.
	6.	Auth – Sign-up / Sign-in / JWT; roles: editor, admin.
	7.	Branding – Navy #001E3C & Emerald #00B37E, fra-logo.svg in header, no avatar images in lists.

5.2 Nice-to-Have
	•	GPT-4o “best publish time” hint.
	•	Slack webhook on publish success.
	•	Supabase storage for uploaded images.

5.3 Out of Scope
	•	Multi-tenant billing
	•	Full digital-asset manager
	•	i18n / localisation

6 User Stories (abridged)

Pri	Story	Acceptance
P0	Create post → appears in drawer & badge instantly.	201 response, drawer shows item, day dot increments.
P0	Click a date → see only Scheduled posts for that day.	GET /posts?day=YYYY-MM-DD returns filtered list.
P1	Drag LinkedIn post from Monday to Tuesday.	PATCH publishDate; calendar re-renders in < 200 ms.


⸻

7 Functional Requirements

ID	Requirement
API-1	GET /api/posts?day=YYYY-MM-DD → Scheduled posts between 00:00–23:59 UTC for that day.
API-2	POST /api/posts validates pillar & platform enums; publishDate must be ISO.
FE-1	usePosts hook keyed by [posts, YYYY-MM-DD].
FE-2	Drawer empty-state: centred grey text “No scheduled posts for this day.”
FE-3	Logo left, title right; header height 56 px; click logo → navigates home.


⸻

8 Non-Functional
	•	Performance: First paint ≤ 200 ms on M1 Air.
	•	Security: JWT secret ≥ 64 hex chars; rate-limit auth 10 req/min.
	•	Dev XP: ESLint strict; Vitest ≥ 90 % line coverage; CI in GitHub Actions.
	•	Ops: /healthz returns 200; Fly.io deploy < 60 s.

9 Data Model (Prisma excerpt)

model Post {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  title       String   @db.VarChar(120)
  description String?
  platform    Platform
  pillar      Pillar
  publishDate DateTime
  status      Status   @default(Scheduled)
  imageUrl    String?  @db.VarChar(2048)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}

enum Platform { TikTok X LinkedIn Instagram }
enum Pillar {
  LifeStartup
  HumanIntro
  LifeInSF
  IndustryInsights
}
enum Status { Draft Scheduled Published }

10 API Contract

Method	Path	Query / Body	Returns
GET	/api/posts	day=YYYY-MM-DD (optional)	200 Post[]
POST	/api/posts	CreatePostDTO	201 Post
PATCH	/api/posts/:id	PartialPostDTO	200 Post
DELETE	/api/posts	[ids] array	204


⸻

11 UX / UI Guidelines
	•	Neutral, clean: #f8fafc background; cards border-gray-100 + shadow-sm.
	•	No avatars: remove people icons; focus on text hierarchy.
	•	Responsive: Sidebar collapses; drawer slides up on < 768 px.
	•	Calendar dot colours: TikTok #FE2C55, X #1D9BF0, LinkedIn #0A66C2, Instagram #E1306C.

12 Timeline

Day	Milestone
0	Kick-off & repo scaffold
2	Auth, Prisma schema, Zod config validation
4	Calendar view, day drawer, GET filter
5	Post creation modal, real-time invalidation
6	UI polish, logo, empty state
7	Internal demo & KPI instrumentation


⸻

13 Risks & Mitigations

Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Date parsing errors	Medium	Front-end always sends .toISOString(); backend uses z.coerce.date().
Missing env vars	High	Zod fails fast with explicit message.
pino-pretty missing in prod	Low	Prod log transport set to "silent".


⸻

14 Open Questions
	1.	Allow editing a Published post?
	2.	Need approval workflow beyond admin/editor?
	3.	Audit trail or versioning required for compliance?
